# DPMS Keycloak

Please use the official documentation to setup keycloak. 

Quick Notes: 
- Keycloak requires https/SSL if used in production
- if you set it up as an own docker container, you can use nginx (https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy, and set up the SSL certificate easily with certbot (https://certbot.eff.org/)
